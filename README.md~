<h1> Crash Boom Bop </h1></br>

<p>This application is a motion sensing game. A picture of the device is shown on in the game screen and animates to show the user which action to take. The accelerometer tracks the user's movements and determines if the device was shaken in the x, y or z directions and uses that information to see if the user properly completed a given directions. Click/Tap cases are also possible. With increasing score the allowable response time for a direction decreases, as does time between each direction. At higher scores, bonus cases (rearranging buttons, how many taps/shakes in a given time limit) appear, as does 3 sequence random combo's. The user's game performace is tracked in an SQLite DB and displayed in an Activity using aChartEngine API (https://code.google.com/p/achartengine/)</p>

<p>TODO: 1) A small tutorial or introduction 2) Removing Toasts for 'Streak!', 'Bonus!', 'Combo' notifications (AKA improving the appearance in game) 3) Rewording some of the available graphs 4) Lower threshold score for different medals 5) More visually stimulating game play (possibly subtle background animations/movements) 6) Any ideas?

<p>Check it out on Google Play. You should totally buy it.</p>
