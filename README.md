<h1> Crash Boom Bop </h1></br>

<p>This application is a motion sensing game. From the main menu a user can navigate to the game or a profile. In the game, a picture of a smartphone is shown and animates to show the user which action to take. The accelerometer tracks the user's movements and determines if the device was shaken in the x, y or z directions and uses that information to see if the user properly completed the given direction. Click/Tap cases are also possible. With increasing score the allowable response time for a respone decreases, as does time between being given each direction. At higher scores, bonus cases (rearranging buttons, how many taps/shakes in a given time limit) appear, as does 3 sequence random combo's. The user's game performace is tracked in an SQLite DB and displayed in an Activity using aChartEngine API (https://code.google.com/p/achartengine/)</p>

<ul>TODO: 
  <li>1) A small tutorial or introduction</li>
  <li>2) Removing Toasts for 'Streak!', 'Bonus!', 'Combo' notifications (AKA improving the appearance in game) </li>
  <li>3) Rewording some of the available graphs </li>
  <li>4) Lower threshold score for different medals </li>
  <li>5) More visually stimulating game play (possibly subtle background animations/movements) </li>
  <li>6) Any ideas? Email me @ jtronlabs@gmail.com</li>
</ul>

<p>Check it out on Google Play. You should totally buy it.</p>
